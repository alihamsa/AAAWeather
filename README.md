#AAA Wather
## A student app for NSS 

This is a student project to practice interacting with APIs.
We've created a basic Javascipt app that displays weather data based on city or zip code searches and allows users to save their favorite weather using Firebase.
The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API and Firebase.
